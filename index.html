        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a rising senior (class of 2025) studying computer engineering at
          Brown University. My areas of interest include 3D graphics, systems
          programming, web development, robotics, and high performance
          electronics. I have enjoyed being a teaching assistant for three
          computer science courses,

          P.S. The cows rotating in the background are from one of my graphics
          projects. One of the features from this project allows users to
          simplify complex meshes while retaining their general context. The
          pink cow includes 5804 unique triangle faces while the yellow cow
          includes only 804 faces, reducing the file size by over 87%.

        <h2>ðŸ”­ Projects</h2>

        <h3>Physically Accurate Simulation</h3>
        <p>
          During my sixth semester I took
          <mark><a href="https://cs2240.graphics/">CS2240</a></mark
          >, Advanced Graphics, which included five intensive projects,
          including an open ended group implementation and extension of a recent
          graphics paper. One of these projects was designing and building a
          physical simulation engine using the finite element method (FEM). This
          project explores advanced mechanics, collision detection and
          resolution, surface mesh extraction, and a system-solver design
          paradigm. The engine was built using primarily C++ and OpenGL.

        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>ReSTIR/NRC</h3>
        <p>
          My final project for Advanced Graphics was an implementation of
          <mark

          and

              href="https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2021-06_real-time-neural-radiance-caching-path-tracing"
              >NRC</a
            ></mark
          >
          for vastly improved path tracing both visually and in performance. We
          primarily used C++, OptiX, and CUDA to implement both papers on top of
          a preexisting path tracer implementation. The left side of the video
          is path tracing with our improvements and the right side of the video
          is path tracing without ReSTIR and NRC.

        <h3>Computer Science Concentration Manager</h3>
        <p>
          With a team of three others, we built the
          <mark
            ><a
              href="https://github.com/cs0320-s2023/final-project-afunk3-jhirschh-aagvania-hpeter11"

              Computer Science Concentration Manager
            </a></mark
          >
          for our final project in
          <mark><a href="https://cs0320.github.io/">CS32</a></mark
          >. Below are two screenshots of the interface, one without the
          information boxes displayed and one with the boxes. The goal of the
          project was to provide computer science students at Brown an
          easy-to-use tool to non-deterministically generate a schedule based on
          the user's preferences and previous courses.
        </p>

          class="maze-gif"
        />
        <p>
          The tool provides many user tested and suggested features, including a
          custom graduation year, a dropdown with different pathway options, a
          search bar with an up-to-date database of courses that can be used to
          fulfill the computer science ScB requirements, a table with different
          categories to sort courses into, an interactive schedule that allows
          for easy and intuitive editing, and several more quality of life
          features. Using these constraints, a backend optimizer built using
          Google OR-Tools creates a suggested schedule that differs with each
          generation, even when given the same inputs. The backend is written
          primarily with Java, while the frontend uses HTML/CSS/TypeScript with
          React, Node.js, Jekyll, and more.

        />
        <br />

        <h3>Itsy Bitsy Spider</h3>
        <p>
          My final project for
          <mark><a href="https://cs1230.graphics/">CS1230</a></mark> was
          <mark
            ><a href="https://github.com/jqhc/CS1230-Final-Project"
              >Itsy Bitsy Spider</a
            ></mark
          >, a user-controlled spider that uses inversed kinematics to animate
          its legs. The project utilizes OpenGL and C++ as its primary
          technologies. This was a partner project that we designed to further
          our skills with graphics programming. The idea to use inverse
          kinematics is borrowed from the field of robotics and involves solving
          a set of complex equations to determine the angles between leg
          segments given the position of the foot and the shoulder.

          >
          is built using Python and PyGame. The project provides a visual and
          interactive demo of Dijkstra's algorithm and gives intuition into how
          it works. The program allows users to change the size of the board,
          randomly generate mazes, create and edit mazes, place custom start and
          end points, clear the canvas, and run/rerun Dijkstra's algorithm. The
          project has states for both possible and impossible maze designs,
          using a wave of blue tiles to indicate where the algorithm has
          searched and a yellow path to indicate the shortest path to solve the
          maze. The project is built to be easily extensible to incorporate
          other search algorithms, such as A* and TrÃ©maux's algorithm.

        <h3>Intern, Technology Developer</h3>
        <h4>Barclays</h4>
        <p>
          For 10 weeks between my junior and senior years (2025), I worked at
          <mark><a href="https://home.barclays/">Barclays</a></mark
          >, one of the largest and oldest banks in the world. I worked on the
          wholesale lending team, developing new requested features for high
          volume loan trading, notably a security feature that prevents
          unsettled trades from being prematurely closed. The primary languages
          and technologies I worked with were Java, TypeScript, React, Spring,
          Hibernate, and AWS.

          with the end users of my product in order to add features and improve
          the tool to fit their needs. The technologies used include WPF, C#,
          and SQL. Most of the key features are showcased in the video below. I

        <h3>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</h3>
        <h4>Brown University</h4>
        <p>
          I was a UTA for CSCI 0190 for the Fall 2022 semester and was a UTA for
          CSCI 0300 for the Spring 2023 semester. My responsibilities for CS19
          included grading 5 to 10 programming assignments for 4 hours per week;
          running weekly 2-hour labs for ~25 students on various topics,
          including Git, Linux commands, SQL, and more; holding 2-hour weekly
          office hours to help ~8 students with conceptual and practical
          questions; and expanding the class's mentorship program, which
          included mentoring 5 students. As a UTA for CS300, my responsibilities
          included holding project and lab specific office hours for 3 hr/week
          for assignments focused on C/C++ programming, multithreading, and
          more; grading ~12 project submissions weekly or biweekly, depending on
          deadlines; and helping students with debugging through the class's
          online discussion board. For the Fall 2023 semester I was a UTA for
          CSCI 1230, Introduction to Computer Graphics. I worked on several
          course improvements including new scenes for grading and testing, I
          held office hours and one-on-one grading sessions, and mentored three
          final project groups from conception to product.
        </p>
        <h3>iD Tech Camps</h3>
        <p>
          This role was a lot of fun, I acted as a mix between camp counselor
          and programming instructor, which required me to actively work for ~17
          hr/day Sunday through Friday. While a lot of work, I found the
          experience to be very rewarding. I had to opportunity to teach courses
          on machine learning with Python to high schoolers, Java programming
          for high schoolers, game design with Roblox to middle schoolers, and
          Scratch to 7 and 8 year olds. The class sizes ranged from 5 to 12 with
          the whole camp being a maximum of around 60 campers. Some campers
          would spend the night, so my team and I would be responsible for
          feeding and taking care of ~20 campers per week, 24/7. I got to work
          with students of all backgrounds and ability, and learned a lot about
          teamwork, leadership, and education.
        </p>
        <h3>Biocore LLC</h3>
        <p>
          Biocore is a biomechanics lab contracted by the NFL to develop safety
          standards for various equipment, most prominantly helmets and cleats.
          This was a part time position in high school that I got because my dad
          was a part of the relatively small company. I'm including it here
          because it was my first working experience and gave me a lot of
          insight into engineering as a profession. I got hands-on experience
          with 3D printing mouth scans of NFL players for specialized mouth
          guard manufacturing, construction of multiple types of specialized
          equipment (including trays of artificial turf and mouth guard
          sanitation cases), and hardware testing with Python and Jupyter
          Notebooks.
