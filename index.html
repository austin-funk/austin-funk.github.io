        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a rising junior (class of 2025) studying computer engineering at
          Brown University. My areas of interest include web development,
          systems programming, 3D graphics, robotics, and general electronics. I
          enjoy teaching and have been a teaching assistant for two computer
          science courses,
          <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2022/staff.html">CS19</a>
          and
          <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0300/2023/staff.html"
            >CS300</a
          >, and I'll be a teaching assistant for
          <a href="https://cs1230.graphics/">CS1230</a> for the Fall 2023
          semester. I've also worked for
          <a href="https://www.idtech.com/">iD Tech Camps</a> and in the
          <a href="https://h2r.cs.brown.edu/">Humans to Robots lab</a>. I'll be
          working at <a href="https://www.hologic.com/">Hologic</a> this Summer
          as a systems engineering intern. A few of my projects are featured on
          this site but feel free to visit my Github pages
          <a href="https://github.com/austin-funk">here</a> and
          <a href="https://github.com/chezgr8r">here</a>. Beyond academics, I'm
          an Eagle Scout, I'm a member of IgniteCS at Brown, and I love playing
          my alto saxophone.
        </p>

          I do, feel free to reach out via

        <p>
          My
          <a href="https://github.com/chezgr8r/maze-solver">maze solver</a> is
          built using Python and PyGame. The project provides a visual and
          interactive demo of Dijkstra's algorithm and gives intuition into how
          it works. The program allows users to change the size of the board,
          randomly generate mazes, create and edit mazes, place custom start and
          end points, clear the canvas, and run/rerun Dijkstra's algorithm. The
          project has states for both possible and impossible maze designs,
          using a wave of blue tiles to indicate where the algorithm has
          searched and a yellow path to indicate the shortest path to solve the
          maze. The project is built to be easily extensible to incorporate
          other search algorithms, such as A* and TrÃ©maux's algorithm.

          My final project for <a href="https://cs1230.graphics/">CS1230</a> was
          <a href="https://github.com/jqhc/CS1230-Final-Project"
            >Itsy Bitsy Spider</a
          >, a user-controlled spider that uses inversed kinematics to animate
          its legs. The project utilizes OpenGL and C++ as its primary
          technologies. This was a partner project that we designed to further
          our skills with graphics programming. The idea to use inverse
          kinematics is borrowed from the field of robotics and involves solving
          a set of complex equations to determine the angles between leg
          segments given the position of the foot and the shoulder.

        <p>
          I've worked in the
          <a href="https://h2r.cs.brown.edu/">Humans to Robots lab</a> under
          <a href="https://jamestompkin.com/">Professor James Tompkin</a> and
          PhD student
          <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/er35/">Eric Rosen</a>, along with
          a team of other undergraduates. We worked on expanding the
          <a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2017-12-14/robotvr"
            >VR teleoperation</a
          >
          project, applying developed technology to a different VR headset and
          robot, specifically the Oculus and Boston Dynamics SPOT. Some of the
          key technologies involved include ROS and Unity.

        <h1>ðŸ’¼ Work History</h1>

        <h3>Intern, Systems Engineer</h3>
        <h4>Hologic</h4>
        <p>
          For the duration of this summer I am working at
          <a href="https://www.hologic.com/">Hologic</a>, a medical devices
          manufacturer and innovator. As of updating the site, I've only been
          working there for two weeks, so I've only had the opportunity to work
          on one substantial project so far. I'm nearly finished with a desktop
          application that will allow engineers and technicians to quickly and
          easily change the device settings of one of Hologic's diagnostic
          machines (it isn't on the market in the United States just yet, but
          will be very soon). The application is built as a separate project
          within the codebase, but utilizes many shared interfaces. The
          technologies used include WPF, C#, .NET, and SQL, and some of the
          planned features include favorites or recent settings and a search
          bar. I'm looking forward to everything I'll learn this summer!
        </p>
        <h3>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</h3>
        <h4>Brown University</h4>
        <p>
          I was a UTA for CSCI 0190 for the Fall 2022 semester and was a UTA for
          CSCI 0300 for the Spring 2023 semester. My responsibilities for CS19
          included grading 5 to 10 programming assignments for 4 hours per week;
          running weekly 2-hour labs for ~25 students on various topics,
          including Git, Linux commands, SQL, and more; holding 2-hour weekly
          office hours to help ~8 students with conceptual and practical
          questions; and expanding the class's mentorship program, which
          included mentoring 5 students. As a UTA for CS300, my responsibilities
          included holding project and lab specific office hours for 3 hr/week
          for assignments focused on C/C++ programming, multithreading, and
          more; grading ~12 project submissions weekly or biweekly, depending on
          deadlines; and helping students with debugging through the class's
          online discussion board. For the upcoming Fall 2023 semester, I will
          be a UTA for CSCI 1230, Introduction to Computer Graphics. I'll be
          working to improve the class over the summer in several ways,
          including improvements to the grading infrastructure to make the
          process faster and smoother for both students and staff.
        </p>
        <h3>iD Tech Camps</h3>
        <p>
          This role was a lot of fun, I acted as a mix between camp counselor
          and programming instructor, which required me to actively work for ~17
          hr/day Sunday through Friday. While a lot of work, I found the
          experience to be very rewarding. I had to opportunity to teach courses
          on machine learning with Python to high schoolers, Java programming
          for high schoolers, game design with Roblox to middle schoolers, and
          Scratch to 7 and 8 year olds. The class sizes ranged from 5 to 12 with
          the whole camp being a maximum of around 60 campers. Some campers
          would spend the night, so my team and I would be responsible for
          feeding and taking care of ~20 campers per week, 24/7. I got to work
          with students of all backgrounds and ability, and learned a lot about
          teamwork, leadership, and education.

        <h3>Biocore LLC</h3>
        <p>
          Biocore is a biomechanics lab contracted by the NFL to develop safety
          standards for various equipment, most prominantly helmets and cleats.
          This was a part time position in high school that I got because my dad
          was a part of the relatively small company. I'm including it here
          because it was my first working experience and gave me a lot of
          insight into engineering as a profession. I got hands-on experience
          with 3D printing mouth scans of NFL players for specialized mouth
          guard manufacturing, construction of multiple types of specialized
          equipment (including trays of artificial turf and mouth guard
          sanitation cases), and hardware testing with Python and Jupyter
          Notebooks.
