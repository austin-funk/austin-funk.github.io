        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a recent graduate of Brown University, having earned a Bachelor's 
          of Science in computer engineering with Honors. My areas of interest 
          include 3D graphics, augmented reality, and Android development. I 
          am currently a software engineer through the Atlas program at 
          <mark><a href="https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/">Siemens EDA</a></mark> in the Bay 
          Area of California. During my time at Brown, I was a teaching assistant 
          for four computer science courses and one engineering course.

        <p>
          The cows rotating in the background are from one of my graphics
          projects. One of the features from this project allows users to
          simplify complex meshes while retaining their general context. The
          pink cow includes 5804 unique triangle faces while the yellow cow
          includes only 804 faces, reducing the file size by over 87%.

        <h3>Honor's Thesis</h3>
        <p>
          I worked in Professor Sherief Reda's 
          <mark><a href="https://scale-lab.github.io/">SCALE lab</a></mark> on my
          undergraduate thesis, titled <mark><a 
            href="https://scale-lab.github.io/pdfs/Austin_Funk_Thesis.pdf">
          <em>Efficient Multi-Task Learning for Augmented Reality</em></a></mark> 
          , as the primary requirement for earning Honors in computer engineering. 
          My thesis explores the different advantages of various multi-task learning 
          architectures for augmented reality applications, specifically in the context
          of depth estimation and semantic segmentation. I conducted this experimentation 
          using <mark><a href="https://github.com/scale-lab/BeAR-app">BeAR</a></mark>, 
          an Android app I developed for real-time benchmarking of multi-task models 
          suited to augmented reality. Based on the collected data, I proposed and 
          implemented two methodologies for running inference that take advantage of 
          the unique architecture of multi-task models. The first method spread
          computation granularly across the device's processing units, and the second 
          method pipelines the encoder and decoder of the model to run in parallel. 
          When used in tandem, these strategies improved performance by up to 73% 
          compared to the baseline.

        <p>
          I worked in the Interactive 3D Vision & Learning Lab (<mark
            ><a href="https://ivl.cs.brown.edu/">IVL</a></mark
          >) on text-to-motion generation for 3D hand actions using diffusion and 
          natural language. This position was originally funded via an UTRA award under

          > during the Fall 2023 semester, and I continued working in the lab 
          for the two subsequent semesters. I contributed primarily to script generation, 
          data collection, and language variety verification. The work I did with PhD 
          candidate Rao Fu led to <mark><a href="https://ivl.cs.brown.edu/research/gigahands.html">GigaHands</a></mark>, 
          the most extensive 3D bimanual manipulation, interaction, and gesture dataset 
          (to our knowledge). Our paper was accepted to CVPR 2025 as a highlight, a 
          distinction given to only 2.98% of submissions.

        <h4>Barclays</h4>
        <p>
          For 10 weeks between my junior and senior years (2025), I worked at
          <mark><a href="https://home.barclays/">Barclays</a></mark
          >, one of the largest and oldest banks in the world. I worked on the
          wholesale lending team, developing new requested features for high
          volume loan trading, notably a security feature that prevents
          unsettled trades from being prematurely closed. The primary languages
          and technologies I worked with were Java, TypeScript, React, Spring,

        <p>
          <span class="lb">I was a TA for CS19 during my Fall 2022 semester.</span> My responsibilities for 
          the course included grading student programming assignments during in-person staff 
          meetings for 4 hours each week; running weekly 2-hour labs on various introductory 
          topics, including Git, Linux, SQL, and more; holding 2-hour weekly office hours to 
          help students with conceptual and practical debugging; and expanding the class's 
          mentorship program, which included mentoring a small group students as they planned 
          their college career.
        </p>
        <h5><u>CSCI0300: Fundamentals of Computer Systems</u></h5>
        <p>
          <span class="lb">I was a TA for CS300 during my Spring 2023 and Spring 2024 semesters.</span> 
          As a TA for the course, my responsibilities included holding project and lab specific 
          office hours for 3 hours per week for assignments focused on C/C++ programming, 
          multithreading, and other integral systems concepts; grading project submissions 
          approximately biweekly; hosting in-person topic presentations once a week; and helping 
          students with debugging through the class's online discussion board.
        </p>
        <h5><u>CSCI1230: Computer Graphics</u></h5>
        <p>
          <span class="lb">I was a TA for CS1230 during my Fall 2023 semester.</span> My responsibilities 
          included holding weekly office hours for 3 hours per week to help students with 
          debugging and conceptual questions; grading projects and written assignments via 
          in-person meetings for 2.5 hours per week; reorganizing project stencils; rewriting 
          scene files for grading and student testing; and mentoring multiple final project 
          groups as they developed unique and challenging products.
        </p>
        <h5><u>ENGN1630: Digital Electronics System Design</u></h5>
        <p>
          <span class="lb">I was a TA for ENGN1630 during my Fall 2024 semester.</span> 
          Unlike previous courses, my primary responsibility was to hold lab hours with no 
          grading or course development responsibilities. I spent 8 hours per week in the 
          computer lab, assisting students with projects and assignments ranging from 
          basic block-based logic gate design to complex FPGA programming in Verilog. I 
          learned a lot about physical debugging and got to know students more personally 
          than in other courses with less in-person interaction.
        </p>
        <h5><u>CSCI1952Y: Computer Architecture</u></h5>
        <p>
          <span class="lb">I was a TA for CSCI1952Y during my Spring 2025 semester.</span> 
          My responsibilities included holding weekly office hours for 3 hours per week 
          to help students with conceptual and coding questions related to caching, 
          pipelining, branch prediction, and other computer architecture topics; grading 
          submissions approximately biweekly; and answering specific project questions on 
          the class's online discussion board.
        </p>
        <h3>Technical Instructor</h3>
        <h4>iD Tech Camps</h4>
        <p>
          My role was somewhere between camp counselor and programming instructor, which 
          required me to be actively engaged for most waking hours Sunday through Friday. 
          Though the time commitment was substantial, I found the experience to be very 
          rewarding. I had to opportunity to teach a variety of courses, including machine 
          learning with Python, Java programming and app development, game design and Lua 
          scripting in Roblox, and MIT's Scratch block coding. The whole camp had a maximum of 
          around 60 campers some weeks with some campers staying overnight, requiring a high 
          level of responsibility that was unique to my previous organizing experiences. I had 
          the priviledge of working with students of all backgrounds and ability, and learned 
          a lot about teamwork, leadership, and education.

          During my sixth semester I took
          <mark><a href="https://cs2240.graphics/">CS2240</a></mark
          >, Advanced Graphics, which included five intensive projects,
          including an open ended group implementation and extension of a recent
          graphics paper. One of these projects was designing and building a
          physical simulation engine using the finite element method (FEM). This
          project explores advanced mechanics, collision detection and
          resolution, surface mesh extraction, and a system-solver design
          paradigm. The engine was built using primarily C++ and OpenGL.

          for vastly improved path tracing both visually and in performance. We
          primarily used C++, OptiX, and CUDA to implement both papers on top of
          a preexisting path tracer implementation. The left side of the video
          is path tracing with our improvements and the right side of the video
          is path tracing without ReSTIR and NRC.

          >. Below are two screenshots of the interface, one without the
          information boxes displayed and one with the boxes. The goal of the
          project was to provide computer science students at Brown an
          easy-to-use tool to non-deterministically generate a schedule based on
          the user's preferences and previous courses.

          The tool provides many user tested and suggested features, including a
          custom graduation year, a dropdown with different pathway options, a
          search bar with an up-to-date database of courses that can be used to
          fulfill the computer science ScB requirements, a table with different
          categories to sort courses into, an interactive schedule that allows
          for easy and intuitive editing, and several more quality of life
          features. Using these constraints, a backend optimizer built using
          Google OR-Tools creates a suggested schedule that differs with each
          generation, even when given the same inputs. The backend is written
          primarily with Java, while the frontend primarily uses TypeScript with
          React.

          >, a user-controlled spider that uses inversed kinematics to animate
          its legs. The project utilizes OpenGL and C++ as its primary
          technologies. This was a partner project that we designed to further
          our skills with graphics programming. The idea to use inverse
          kinematics is borrowed from the field of robotics and involves solving
          a set of complex equations to determine the angles between leg
          segments given the position of the foot and the shoulder.

          is built using Python and PyGame. The project provides a visual and
          interactive demo of Dijkstra's algorithm and gives intuition into how
          it works. The program allows users to change the size of the board,
          randomly generate mazes, create and edit mazes, place custom start and
          end points, clear the canvas, and run/rerun Dijkstra's algorithm. The
          project has states for both possible and impossible maze designs,
          using a wave of blue tiles to indicate where the algorithm has
          searched and a yellow path to indicate the shortest path to solve the
          maze. The project is built to be easily extensible to incorporate
          other search algorithms, such as A* and TrÃ©maux's algorithm.
