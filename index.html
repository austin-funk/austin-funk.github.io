        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a rising junior (class of 2025) studying computer engineering at
          Brown University. My areas of interest include web development,
          systems programming, 3D graphics, robotics, and general electronics. I
          enjoy teaching and have been a teaching assistant for two computer
          science courses,
          <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2022/staff.html">CS19</a>
          and
          <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0300/2023/staff.html"
            >CS300</a
          >, and I'll be a teaching assistant for
          <a href="https://cs1230.graphics/">CS1230</a> for the Fall 2023
          semester. I've also worked for
          <a href="https://www.idtech.com/">iD Tech Camps</a> and in the
          <a href="https://h2r.cs.brown.edu/">Humans to Robots lab</a>. I am
          working at <a href="https://www.hologic.com/">Hologic</a> for this
          Summer as a systems engineering intern. A few of my projects are
          featured on this site but feel free to visit my Github pages
          <a href="https://github.com/austin-funk">here</a> and
          <a href="https://github.com/chezgr8r">here</a>. Beyond academics, I'm
          an Eagle Scout, I'm a member of IgniteCS at Brown, and I love playing
          my alto saxophone.
        </p>

        <h2>ðŸ”­ Projects</h2>

        <h3>Computer Science Concentration Manager</h3>
        <p>
          With a team of three others, we built the
          <a
            href="https://github.com/cs0320-s2023/final-project-afunk3-jhirschh-aagvania-hpeter11"
          >
            Computer Science Concentration Manager
          </a>
          for our final project in <a href="https://cs0320.github.io/">CS32</a>.
          Below are two screenshots of the interface, one without the
          information boxes displayed and one with the boxes. The goal of the
          project was to provide computer science students at Brown an
          easy-to-use tool to non-deterministically generate a schedule based on
          the user's preferences and previous courses.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/CSCM_no_info.png"

          style="width: 700px; height: 341px"
          class="maze-gif"
        />
        <p>
          The tool provides many user tested and suggested features, including a
          custom graduation year, a dropdown with different pathway options, a
          search bar with an up-to-date database of courses that can be used to
          fulfill the computer science ScB requirements, a table with different
          categories to sort courses into, an interactive schedule that allows
          for easy and intuitive editing, and several more quality of life
          features. Using these constraints, a backend optimizer built using
          Google OR-Tools creates a suggested schedule that differs with each
          generation, even when given the same inputs. The backend is written
          primarily with Java, while the frontend uses HTML/CSS/TypeScript with
          React, Node.js, Jekyll, and more.

        />
        <br />

        <h3>Itsy Bitsy Spider</h3>
        <p>
          My final project for <a href="https://cs1230.graphics/">CS1230</a> was
          <a href="https://github.com/jqhc/CS1230-Final-Project"
            >Itsy Bitsy Spider</a
          >, a user-controlled spider that uses inversed kinematics to animate
          its legs. The project utilizes OpenGL and C++ as its primary
          technologies. This was a partner project that we designed to further
          our skills with graphics programming. The idea to use inverse
          kinematics is borrowed from the field of robotics and involves solving
          a set of complex equations to determine the angles between leg
          segments given the position of the foot and the shoulder.
        </p>

          class="maze-gif"
        />
        <br />

        <h3>Maze Solver</h3>
        <p>
          My
          <a href="https://github.com/chezgr8r/maze-solver">maze solver</a> is
          built using Python and PyGame. The project provides a visual and
          interactive demo of Dijkstra's algorithm and gives intuition into how
          it works. The program allows users to change the size of the board,
          randomly generate mazes, create and edit mazes, place custom start and
          end points, clear the canvas, and run/rerun Dijkstra's algorithm. The
          project has states for both possible and impossible maze designs,
          using a wave of blue tiles to indicate where the algorithm has
          searched and a yellow path to indicate the shortest path to solve the
          maze. The project is built to be easily extensible to incorporate
          other search algorithms, such as A* and TrÃ©maux's algorithm.

        <h1>ðŸ’¼ Work History</h1>

        <h3>Intern, Systems Engineer</h3>
        <h4>Hologic</h4>
        <p>
          For the duration of this summer I am working at
          <a href="https://www.hologic.com/">Hologic</a>, a medical devices
          manufacturer and innovator. As of updating the site, I've successfully
          finished a desktop application that allows engineers and technicians
          to quickly and easily change the device settings of one of
          <a
            href="https://www.hologic.com/hologic-products/cytology/genius-digital-diagnostics-system"
            >Hologic's diagnostic machines</a
          >. The technologies used include WPF, C#, .NET, and SQL. Some of the
          features include custom favorites, uploading new settings from JSON
          files, importing and exporting the current settings as a CSV or in a
          more human-readable format, a searchbar that utilizes Levenshtein
          distance to find settings within a tree structure, and is stateful to
          allow for one-time setup. I've made changes and added features based
          on the needs of senior developers in my division, including tooltips
          for favorites, highlighting favorite settings whose values differ from
          the original JSONs, and adjustments to the UI to account for the
          smaller screen size of the imager. I am in the process of installing
          cameras with custom scripting into some of the test imagers, and will
          start on a computer vision project using OpenCV to help the imager
          intelligently find medical slides at some point soon.
        </p>
        <h3>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</h3>
        <h4>Brown University</h4>
        <p>
          I was a UTA for CSCI 0190 for the Fall 2022 semester and was a UTA for
          CSCI 0300 for the Spring 2023 semester. My responsibilities for CS19
          included grading 5 to 10 programming assignments for 4 hours per week;
          running weekly 2-hour labs for ~25 students on various topics,
          including Git, Linux commands, SQL, and more; holding 2-hour weekly
          office hours to help ~8 students with conceptual and practical
          questions; and expanding the class's mentorship program, which
          included mentoring 5 students. As a UTA for CS300, my responsibilities
          included holding project and lab specific office hours for 3 hr/week
          for assignments focused on C/C++ programming, multithreading, and
          more; grading ~12 project submissions weekly or biweekly, depending on
          deadlines; and helping students with debugging through the class's
          online discussion board. For the upcoming Fall 2023 semester, I will
          be a UTA for CSCI 1230, Introduction to Computer Graphics. I'll be
          working to improve the class over the summer in several ways,
          including improvements to the grading infrastructure to make the
          process faster and smoother for both students and staff.
        </p>
        <h3>iD Tech Camps</h3>
        <p>
          This role was a lot of fun, I acted as a mix between camp counselor
          and programming instructor, which required me to actively work for ~17
          hr/day Sunday through Friday. While a lot of work, I found the
          experience to be very rewarding. I had to opportunity to teach courses
          on machine learning with Python to high schoolers, Java programming
          for high schoolers, game design with Roblox to middle schoolers, and
          Scratch to 7 and 8 year olds. The class sizes ranged from 5 to 12 with
          the whole camp being a maximum of around 60 campers. Some campers
          would spend the night, so my team and I would be responsible for
          feeding and taking care of ~20 campers per week, 24/7. I got to work
          with students of all backgrounds and ability, and learned a lot about
          teamwork, leadership, and education.
        </p>
        <h3>Biocore LLC</h3>
        <p>
          Biocore is a biomechanics lab contracted by the NFL to develop safety
          standards for various equipment, most prominantly helmets and cleats.
          This was a part time position in high school that I got because my dad
          was a part of the relatively small company. I'm including it here
          because it was my first working experience and gave me a lot of
          insight into engineering as a profession. I got hands-on experience
          with 3D printing mouth scans of NFL players for specialized mouth
          guard manufacturing, construction of multiple types of specialized
          equipment (including trays of artificial turf and mouth guard
          sanitation cases), and hardware testing with Python and Jupyter
          Notebooks.
